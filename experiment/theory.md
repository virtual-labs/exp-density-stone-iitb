<h2> 1. BUOYANCY </h2>

When a body is immersed in a fluid, an upward force is exerted by the fluid on the body. This upward force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body and is called the force of buoyancy or simply buoyancy.

<h2> 2. CENTRE OF BUOYANCY </h2>

It is defined as the point, through which the force of buoyancy is supposed to act. As the force of buoyancy is a vertical force and is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body, the centre of buoyancy will be the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced.
